# Sleep Cycle AnalyserðŸŒ™ðŸ“Š
Hi! This notebook has the purpose of helping users of Sleep Cycle to analyze their data in a more detailed and extensive way. 
I love statistics and data, that is why I felt the need to create a tool that gave me in depth statistics of my sleep patterns.
I have noty finished yet but so far I have created some useful graphs that will certainly be valuable for analyzing your sleep.
You can ingore my comments and conclusions since they are from my own sleep but they might help you in your own analysis.

## How do I use it?
It's super simple, name your data `sleepdata.csv`, paste it on the folder of the repo and replace the old one. 
Finally, run the notebook and you will get your detailed statistics.

## How do I download my data from Sleep Cycle?
For downloading your data from Sleep Cycle go to `Profile`, then `More` and scroll down all the way to the `Others` section were you will find
`Database`, tap there and then tap `Export database to CSV`.
