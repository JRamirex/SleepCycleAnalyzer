# Sleep Cycle AnalyserðŸŒ™ðŸ“Š
Hi! This notebook has the purpose of helping users of Sleep Cycle to analyze their data in a more detailed and extensive way. 
I love statistics and data, that is why I felt the need to create a tool that gave me in depth statistics of my sleep patterns.

## How do I use it?
It's super simple, name your data `sleepdata.csv`, paste it on the folder of the repo and replace the old one. 
Finally, run the notebook and you will get your detailed statistics.

## How do I download my data from Sleep Cycle?
For downloading your data from Sleep Cycle go to `Profile`, then `More` and scroll down all the way to the `Others` section were you will find
`Database`, tap there and then tap `Export database to CSV`.
